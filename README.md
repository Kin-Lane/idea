API Ideas
=========

This is a project to allow the submission, and curation of API ideas.

I want to enable people to submit ideas for APIs.

* Title
* Description

I want this to show on a website, in a list, and other sites.

An API will allow me to do this, and potentially more.

My API will allow me to add, update, get, and delete ideas.

This is a simple datastore, I will store as JSON on Github.

Now i have my idea, I start with a Github repository to get going <-- Here we are!
